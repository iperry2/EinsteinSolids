Einstein Solid Multiplicity and Macrostate Probabilities:
I wrote this code to help in Thermodynamics problems where we were dealing with very large multiplicities.
This repository contains two Python programs: multiplicitytable.py and bargraph.py. 
These programs calculate and display the multiplicity of an Einstein solid and visualize the probabilities of different macrostates using a bar graph.

multiplicitytable.py:

This program calculates the multiplicity of an Einstein solid for two solids (A and B) with a specified total number of energy units.
It prints the multiplicity table for all possible macrostates of the system and calculates the total multiplicity.
bargraph.py:

This program generates a bar graph to visualize the probabilities of different macrostates for an Einstein solid with two parts (A and B).
It considers two different scenarios with varying numbers of oscillators in each solid and a total energy of 6 units.
The program also prints the most and least probable macrostates.
